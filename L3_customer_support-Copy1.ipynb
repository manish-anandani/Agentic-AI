       "Hi there!\n",
       "\n",
       "Thank you for reaching out to us at CrewAI with your inquiry on adding memory to your Crew. We're here to help you set up and optimize your Crew in the best way possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "To add memory to your Crew in CrewAI, you can utilize our Role-Based Agents feature. Role-Based Agents allow you to create specialized agents with defined roles, expertise, and goals. In this case, you can create a Role-Based Agent with a memory management role to handle memory-related tasks efficiently within your Crew.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here are the detailed steps to add memory to a Crew in CrewAI using Role-Based Agents:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Log in to the CrewAI platform using your credentials.\n",
       "2. Navigate to the \"Crew Management\" section.\n",
       "3. Select the specific Crew to which you want to add memory.\n",
       "4. Click on the \"Agents\" tab within the Crew details.\n",
       "5. Identify the Role-Based Agent that you want to assign memory to.\n",
       "6. Access the settings of the selected Role-Based Agent.\n",
       "7. Look for the option to allocate memory to the agent.\n",
       "8. Enter the desired amount of memory you want to assign to the agent (in gigabytes).\n",
       "9. Save your changes to apply the new memory allocation.\n",
       "10. Verify the successful addition of memory by checking the agent's details.\n",
       "\n",
       "By following these steps, you'll be able to effectively add memory to your Crew in CrewAI using Role-Based Agents. Remember to optimize memory usage, handle data securely, and ensure efficient memory allocation to prevent any performance issues or data loss.\n",
       "\n",
       "For more information and detailed functionalities on memory management in CrewAI, you can refer to our documentation on the CrewAI website: https://docs.crewai.com/\n",
       "\n",
       "If you have any additional questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support DeepLearningAI in successfully setting up and optimizing their Crew in CrewAI.\n",
